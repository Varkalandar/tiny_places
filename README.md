# Tiny Places

Tiny Places is meant to become a collaborative map editor and rpg system. The client is built with
the Love2d Lua game framework, the server is Java code.
    
## Start the client

    cd tiny_places
    love tiny_places_client

## Start the server

Instructions to build the server should be here ...

    java -jar tiny_places_server/server.jar

## Get Love2D for Linux

The easiest way seems to be to use the official Love2d PPA.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bartbes/love-stable
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install love
